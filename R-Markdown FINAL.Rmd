abstract: |
   Peopleâ€™s opinions on economic institutions can vary according to the level of development of their countries of residence, which has implications for levels of investment in national and international markets. This paper aims at testing the hypothesis that people who reside in developed countries have a higher level of trust in economic institutions than people who reside in developing countries. We draw on secondary data from the World Values Survey (WVS) for the United States, Mexico, and Chile. For data analyses, we used the software R for producing graphs and statistical inferences. The results do not confirm our hypothesis; there is no homogeneous patter of response according to the level of economic development of the country. The results indicate that people in Mexico have higher confidence in banks than US and Chile inhabitants.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
